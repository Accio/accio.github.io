title: Multiscale modeling in drug discovery: an introductory course for pharmacists
category: DrugDiscovery
---

As a lecturer in the course series *From Novel Targets To Novel Therapeutic Modalities* (2023) at the University of Basel, I have prepared the [slide deck]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/2023-03-UniBaselPharmacy-MultiscaleModelling-JitaoDavidZhang.pdf) for master students in pharmacy.

The key messages I tried to deliver are three-fold.

1. In drug discovery, we are often interested in multiple levels of working mechanism - molecular, cellular/omics, and system/organ-level - of drug candidates.
2. Computational biologists in drug discovery build and use mechanistic, statistic, and causal models.
3. Integrating data and models inform both disease understanding and drug discovery.

Enjoy reading!
