The 4th Roche Predictive Modelling and Data Analytics (PMDA) Summer School shall take place between 4th and 8th of August, 2025. This year's topic is *leveraging protein abundance for drug discovery*.

For the fourth time in a row, we shall host ~12 PhD students enrolled in Swiss universities, and students from EU and UK universities if remaining positions are available. The applicants are expected to bring experience in data analysis and modelling (for instance statistical modeling, machine learning and artificial intelligence, mechanistic modeling, or causal inference), as well as enthusiasm in applying the skills to solve real-world problems in drug discovery. Together we shall address real-world problems in drug discovery and development.

To find out more about the summer school and to register, please visit our website at [https://bedapub.github.io/PMDA-Summer-School](https://bedapub.github.io/PMDA-Summer-School).

All essential information is also included in [this one-pager PDF file](https://bedapub.github.io/PMDA-Summer-School/assets/2025-4th-Roche-PMDA-Summer-School-A4.pdf), which can be shared, printed, and posted anywhere.
