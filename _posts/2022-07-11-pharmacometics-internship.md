---

Our team is looking for a master or PhD student to work on automated modeling
and simulation for population pharmacokinetic models. We offer a 6-month
internship starting from Q3 2022 or availability. [Apply
here](https://careers.roche.com/global/en/job/ROCHGLOBAL202206124965EXTERNALENGLOBAL/Student-Internship-in-Pharmacometrics-6-months).

Population pharmacokinetic models are used in drug development to describe the
time course of drug exposure in patients, and to investigate sources of
variability in patient exposure. The technique can be used to simulate and
assess alternative dose regimens.

Current strategy of population pharmacokinetic models is probably best described
by a complex and iterative process that is manually performed by modelers.
Automatic modelling instead uses algorithms to search for potential models that
best describe a given dataset. Software tools are used to search the space of
models and/or model features, to create and fit a series of candidate models,
and to rank the models by pre-defined selection criteria.

In the position, you will

* Use cutting edge automatic model development tools to develop population
  pharmacokinetic (PK) models based on clinical trial data and/or simulated
  data;
* Attend training sessions to learn about automated modelling and simulation
  processes;
* Attend department meetings to gain an understanding on how modelling and
  simulation influence drug development;
* Present the project results to modelling and data analytics scientists, and
  potentially publish the findings in a high-impact journal.

Requirements for the position:

* You are working towards a Masterâ€™s (or finished it recently), or PhD degree in
  a quantitative discipline (Pharmacometrics, or related field) and you are
  looking for an exciting opportunity to expand your hands-on experience in the
  field of Pharmacometrics in a drug development setting;
* Basic knowledge of Pharmacokinetics, Clinical Pharmacology and clinical drug
  development;
* Basic knowledge of statistics (theory and application);
* Demonstrated competence in coding in R
* Experience with modelling and simulation population software, such as *NONMEM*
  or *Monolix*
* Fluency in written and spoken English
* You have very good interpersonal and communication skills, are able to build
  good working relationships, and are an outstanding teammate.
* Your experience and investigative attitude allow you to work independently, to
  design, perform, and interpret experiments, and to embark on new scientific
  methodologies.
