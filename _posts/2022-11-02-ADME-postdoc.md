title: Postdoc position on intestinal human model systems and applications in modelling
category: Career
---

Our team is looking for a postdoctoral fellow with a strong background in
pharmaceutical science, cell biology, and bioenginnering. The candidate shall
implement novel intestinal human model systems and apply them in drug metabolism
and pharmacokinetics modelling. [Apply
here](https://careers.roche.com/global/en/job/ROCHGLOBAL202210138161EXTERNALENGLOBAL/ADME-Postdoc-Scientist).

This position is co-supervised by scientists in the newly established Roche
Institute of Tissue Bioengineering (ITB) and the Predictive Modeling and Data
Analysis (PMDA) Chapter in Pharmaceutical Sciences within Pharma Research and
Early Development.  The postdoctoral fellow will join our team at the interface
of basic academic and translational research in the area of intestinal human
model systems (HMS) and their application in drug metabolism and
pharmacokinetics (DMPK) modeling.  The postdoc will play a major role in the
development of the intestinal HMS to reduce the current translational gaps with
the current *in vitro* systems.

The postdoc fellow will:

* Collaborate with ITB and PMDA scientists to generate next-generation
  intestinal barrier models and characterize them for the presence and
  functionality of DMPK-relevant features (e.g. transporters and metabolic
  enzymes).
* Qualify intestinal HMS into patient-relevant DMPK assays by demonstrating an
  improvement of the in vivo translatability compared with existing *in vitro*
  systems for orally administered drugs.
* Adapt the system to the needs of preclinical DMPK research and testing,
  ensuring robustness and appropriate throughput.
* Performing in silico modeling of in vitro data and translation to in vivo.
* Communicate the results internally and externally, in the form of posters, presentations and publications.

Your profile

* You hold a PhD, that you have received within the last 4 years (as a maximum) in pharmaceutical science, pharmacokinetics, cell biology, bioengineered or related disciplines.
* Extensive experience with mammalian cell culture is expected. Expertise in 3D culture (organoids, spheroids, organs-on-chips) will be considered an asset.
* Deep knowledge of bio-analytical methods for cell characterization , staining and imaging techniques (e.g. confocal laser scanning microscopy), and sample preparation for LC-MS/MS analysis.
* You have a strong background in all DMPK aspects.
* Preferably you have experience or keen interest in in silico modeling (e.g. code scripting and PBPK modeling).
* You are committed to working in a interdisciplinary project with a large team
* Excellent English skills (written and spoken) and commitment to publishing scientific articles.

The job starts upon availability. A CV, a motivation letter, a publication list
are required in your application. If you are interested, [apply for the position
