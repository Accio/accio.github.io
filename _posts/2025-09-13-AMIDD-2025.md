The AMIDD course will run again at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Sciences, University of Basel.The first lecture takes place on Friday, September the 19<sup>th</sup>.

In the AMIDD course, we learn about the drug discovery process, and how
mathematics and computer science contribute to the end-to-end process. The
course is highly interdisciplinary: Over the years, students in mathematics,
computer science, physics, biology, chemistry, medicine, and other disciplines
have joined the courses, and given feedback to the curriculum so that it is
accessible and understandable for participants of different background.

Information of the course and all materials can be found on [http://amidd.ch](http://amidd.ch). More information on the course can be found [at the course directory of the University Basel](https://vorlesungsverzeichnis.unibas.ch/de/vorlesungsverzeichnis?id=293921).
