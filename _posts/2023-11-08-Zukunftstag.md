On *Zukunftstag* (National Future's Day), girls and boys accompany their parents to their work place in Switzerland. This year, I have the honour to host a workshop with children about programming and data analysis.

We shall simulate a clinical trial, analyse the data, and interpret the results together with a Jupyter notebook.

The source code of the fun project is available [in a GitHub repo](https://github.com/Accio/2023-11-Zukunftstag-2023). And the essential information about the workshop is included in [this one-pager PDF file (German)]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/2023-11-Zukunftstag-schreiben.pdf), which can be shared and printed anywhere.

I want to thank the support of Ralf Horstmoeller, Marie Pachtova, Paul Geser, and David Gaul.
