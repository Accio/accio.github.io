title: Public talk about target and modality selection in drug discovery

Several lines of evidence suggest that target and modality selection are inseparable processes: biology and chemistry must be considered as one in drug discovery. I [gave a talk at the Institute of Molecular Systems Biology at ETH]({{ site.url}}/assets/pdf/2025-04-JitaoDavidZhang-ETH-IMSB.pdf) about this thought, thanks to the invite by [Prof. Pedro Beltrao](https://imsb.ethz.ch/research/beltrao.html).

The talk is motivated by two observations. First, target selection and modality selection in drug discovery have invisible high costs, and remains challenging despite great progress in biology, chemistry, and computational sciences including machine learning and artificially intelligence. Second, protein turnover, i.e. the constant synthesis and degradation of proteins, affects efficacy, potency, ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) properties, and safety of drug candidates. Critically, I believe the impact of turnover on target and modality selection is currently under-appreciated, and the intrinsic link between target biology such as turnover and a drug's efficacy and safety supports the oneness of target and modality selection.

In a review that my colleagues and I am writing, which is currently under revision, we try to illustrate why we believe that protein turnover is essential for target prioritization and modality selection, especially for emerging modalities such as covalent inhibitors and targeted protein degraders. There are still many open questions that I wish can be addressed by the community by working together. The talk gives a glimpse of some of our thoughts, and invites both criticism and collaboration.
