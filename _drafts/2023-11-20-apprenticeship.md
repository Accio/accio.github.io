Complementary to official documents and scholar texts on apprenticeship, this guide is distilled from my firsthand experience, observations, and learnings from working as a vocational trainer for the informatics apprenticeship. In another word, this is a report from an apprentice of the apprenticeship system.

## The Swiss apprenticeship system

Apprenticeship is a system for training a new generation of practitioners of a trade or profession with on-the-job training and often some form of accompanying study. Many forms of apprenticeship have emerged in the history of many countries across the globe. The traditional apprenticeship was already mentioned in the *Code of Hammurabi* composed almost four thousands ago. In China, a mature country-wide system formed around 500 years AD. In Europe, the system of apprentice developed in the later Middle Ages around 1500 AD, and has been supported, formed, and developed by guilds, governments, and apprentices.

In Switzerland, apprenticeship is part of the Vocational Education and Training (VET) system, which is embedded in its permeable education system. After leaving secondary schools, children in Switzerland choose between general education in high school and an apprenticeship. The choice depends on several factors, such as grades, personal interest, and advice from parents, teachers, and social institutions that provide consulting service. Critically, apprenticeship is considered a high-quality, respected education as valuable as general education.

Apprenticeship implements a dual system integrating learning and working. Apprentices spend their time rotating between workplace, vocational school (also known as colleges in America and some other parts of the world), and industry training centers set up by companies or trades. The loop of learning and doing allows apprentices develop complementary practical skills both relating to the profession, for instance programming for an informatics apprentice, as well life-long skills such as time management, decision making, communication, and taking responsibilities.

The apprenticeship takes usually 3-4 years. Once finishing the final exam successfully, the apprentices receive a diploma that certifies their qualification to work in the profession or to pursue higher education, for instance attending applied-research universities. By attending an additional exam known as *Passerelle* (french, originally meaning *footbridge* or *gangway*), they can also attend academic universities.

## My roles in informatics apprentice training

I am a computational biologist working in drug discovery. At the same time, I am a vocational trainer of informatics apprentices. Every year, I work with 1--2 apprentices to work on research informatics and software development projects. I prepare with them together the Individual Project Work (*Individuelle Projektarbeit* in German, or *IPA* in abbreviation), which is part of their final exam in order to get the diploma. Together with two external exam experts, I am responsible to grade their work, and to conduct the oral exam, which covers a broad range of topics in computer science. Last but least, I am responsible for giving feedback to the youths, particularly when they make mistakes, so that they can learn and grow. I learn a lot about how to learn and how to coach others by training apprentices. My personal experience with the apprenticeship system is highly positive.

The system seems to does a great job at higher levels, too. Two thirds of youths in Switzerland choose an apprenticeship when they finish the secondary school. Both public-sector institutions, such as schools, universities, hospitals, and government, as well as private-sector companies offer apprentice training in more than 200 professions, from *Abdichter* (*caulker*, someone whose expertise is to make an object or a space watertight or airtight by filling or sealing) to *Zimmermann/Zimmerin* (*carpenter*). Former CEO of the biggest bank, UBS, the former President of Switzerland, and many other business and political leaders started their career as apprentices. The country has one of the lowest youth unemployment rates in the world, with the average rate between 2018 and 2022 at 2.7%.


## Ten reasons for the success of the apprentice system

Why is the system so successful? Here are ten reasons that I summarize from my observations. While not aiming to be either comprehensive or flawless, these speculations and personal opinions hopefully inspire you to explore more about the system, perhaps by participating in it.


### 1. The apprenticeship has a long history and evolves with time.

Why is the apprenticeship system so successful? First of all, it has a long history in German-speaking countries including Switzerland. The state subsidised vocational training as early as 1884. However, various forms of apprenticeship have also been exercised in many other countries including China for hundreds of years. What makes the Swiss model so special?

My personal conclusion is that it fits the reality of Switzerland, where more than 99% of the private sector is small business with less than 250 people. Apprentices learn both theory and practical skills needed by the industry, both in classrooms and by working with experienced professionals. By training the youngsters, companies maintain their know-how, build a pool of talents, and anchor themselves locally. While these benefits equally apply to large companies, which can afford training more apprentices - my company, for instance, trains around 300 apprentices of 15 professions every year - the dual approach of apprenticeship makes it a promising avenue for both companies and youths, since the company works closely with the apprentices and develops them. The apprentices know the job, the people, and the working environment early in their careers, so that they can decide for themselves the next steps after the apprenticeship.

They learn from successes like a better documented program, an automated workflow, and better performance thanks to better data partition. Even more, they learn from making mistakes and getting timely, constructive feedback from the trainer: Why did the program take forever? Probably because we have made it read too many files. How about restricting the reading procedure to the essential data?

### 2. The apprenticeship is part of a permeable education system.

Here's a brief version: students are classified into three levels: A (allgemein, i.e. general), E (enhanced), and P (pro-gymansium). Both E and A students have to do apprenticeship. P can go into gymnasium, or do an internship.
Roche is such an attractive apprenticeship trainer so that we get mostly P students, as well as college dropouts.

### 3. The apprenticeship has a defined scope and a recognized standard of quality.

Ich denke, der ganz grosse Vorteil einer Berufsausbildung gegenüber dem akademischen Studium ist ein durchweg standardisiertes System, d.h. ein Laborant in Schaffhausen muss das gleiche können, wie ein Laborant in Basel resp. in Hamburg.  An Universitäten hingegen gibt es weder Qualitätsparameter noch Standardisierungen der Lehrinhalte, das unterscheidet sich von Uni zu Uni und von Fachbereich zu Fachbereich. Selbst die Prüfungen sind überall unterschiedlich aufgestellt (ausser bei Staatsexamen). Da gilt: entweder du bringst es dir selbst bei oder du hast jemanden, der sich deiner annimmt, um es dir zu zeigen, so zumindest habe ich es erlebt. Je nach Engagement der einzelnen Dozenten. 

### 4. The apprenticeship minimizes the discrepancy between real-world need and what is taught.

### 5. The apprenticeship teaches how to learn best at a young age.

The apprenticeship system values feedback. Every semester, apprentices have a formal discussion with their supervisor and a professional trainer representing the company. All parties give each other feedback, focusing on different aspects of growth of the apprentice: professional development, team work, customer-oriented thinking, way of working, as well as the ability to reflect. While I was being trained by the company to become an apprentice supervisor, we simulated such sessions in order to improve our skills to set expectations, to appraise achievements, to identify problems or mistakes, and to explore ways to solve them. Those simulations and the following real sessions that I have had with Jannick, Giulia, and other apprentices have taught me valuable lessons on coaching people as a gardener who cultures growth.

### 6. The apprenticeship recognizes the plurality of both intelligence and success.

### 7. The apprenticeship meets the needs of both employers and future employees.

### 8. The apprenticeship promotes regional advantage and sustainable development.

### 9. The apprenticeship helps to glue the society.

### 10. The apprenticeship is a humanistic education.

## Challenges and opportunities faced by the apprentice system

<!--3. Teaching and learning in small group is enjoying but also super luxury. How the new age with AI will change the apprenticeship or even reshape the two-path system?-->

### 1. Accelerated changes in technology and professions pose challenges to apprenticeships.

### 2. A harmonised standard of qualification faces challenges due to heterogeneity of qualities.

### 3. Recognition and appreciation of the apprenticeship system faces challenges.

### 4. Apprenticeship has the opportunity to teach both skills and spirits.

<!--Ich finde das einen sehr schönen Artikel, auch weil mir dieses Thema eine Herzensangelegenheit ist.
In meinen nun fast 50 Berufsjahren habe ich als Ausbilder mehr als 15 Chemielaboranten auf ihrem Berufsweg begleitet. 

Aber gerne möchte ich einige Gedanken zur heutigen Situation der Ausbildung loswerden.

Ich habe meine Ausbildung zum Physiklaboranten in den 70er Jahren bei der Hoechst AG in Frankfurt absolviert.
Damals gab es die Schulabschlüsse Mittlere Reife und Abitur (sicher auch noch andere, aber das war das übliche).
Wer die mittlere Reife erreichte und nicht weiter in die Schule gehen wollte, machte eine 3-4jährige Lehre und arbeitete dann im erlernten Beruf.
Wenige machten weiter als Techniker/Meister, noch weniger holten eine Hochschulreife auf dem 2. Bildungsweg nach.
Und wer das Abitur erlangte, verfolgte einen akademischen Werdegang.
Wie auch heute noch überwiegend im Handwerk üblich, übte man nach der Ausbildung seinen Beruf aus.
In den 70er Jahren lag die Abiturquote bei 20%, heute liegt sie bei 50%.
In unserem Geschäft, der Pharmaindustrie, hat es meines Erachtens einen bedeutenden Wandel gegeben.
Es drängen vermehrt Bachelor- und auch Masterabsolventen der Hochschulen in den Laborantenberuf.
Begünstigt durch die Firmen im Sinne von: wenn ich einen Akademiker zu den gleichen Bedingungen bekomme wie einen Laboranten.....
So entwickelt sich bei vielen der Eindruck "Laborant alleine reicht nicht mehr", und man macht dann nach der Laborantenausbildung weiter, so wie deine beiden Schützlinge.
Das ist persönlich gesehen sehr toll und absolut förderbar, wirft aber ein nicht so gutes Licht auf diejenigen, die nach ihrer Ausbildung einfach nur ihrem erlernten Beruf nachgehen wollen.
Ich finde, es braucht alle:  Akademiker  -  Laboranten mit Weiterbildung  -  aber auch Laboranten, die mit Freude und Begeisterung an der Bench stehen und noch praktisch etwas tun. Und für die ist dieser Lehrberuf.
