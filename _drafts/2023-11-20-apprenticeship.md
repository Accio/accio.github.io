Supplementary information for the blog post

The apprenticeship system sets a high standard while offering a plural definition of success. Part of my job is to support them to prepare for the final examination, known as the Individual Project Work. During the ten-day examination, they work independently in order to deliver a software project as well as a full-fledged written report. After the ten-day exam, the apprentice gives a presentation and demonstrates the product to the mentor and two external experts acting as examiners. Finally, the three experts will conduct an oral exam with the apprentice, which must cover six different topics in informatics. The examination, in my opinion, exemplifies the outstanding organisation of the apprenticeship system.

The apprenticeship system values feedback. Every semester, apprentices have a formal discussion with their supervisor and a professional trainer representing the company. All parties give each other feedback, focusing on different aspects of growth of the apprentice: professional development, team work, customer-oriented thinking, way of working, as well as the ability to reflect. While I was being trained by the company to become an apprentice supervisor, we simulated such sessions in order to improve our skills to set expectations, to appraise achievements, to identify problems or mistakes, and to explore ways to solve them. Those simulations and the following real sessions that I have had with Jannick, Giulia, and other apprentices have taught me valuable lessons on coaching people as a gardener who cultures growth.

Apprenticeships are highly valued in German-speaking countries though used to be little known outside. However, more countries, including the U.S., U.K., and China, have shown growing interest in adopting the system. As an immigrant born in China, where the apprenticeship system had a long history but was until recently sidelined, I predict the change will have a huge positive impact in many countries by creating values to society, giving new views on innovation and thereby reducing youth unemployment.

Why is the apprenticeship system so successful? First of all, it has a long history in German-speaking countries including Switzerland. The state subsidised vocational training as early as 1884. However, various forms of apprenticeship have also been exercised in many other countries including China for hundreds of years. What makes the Swiss model so special?

My personal conclusion is that it fits the reality of Switzerland, where more than 99% of the private sector is small business with less than 250 people. Apprentices learn both theory and practical skills needed by the industry, both in classrooms and by working with experienced professionals. By training the youngsters, companies maintain their know-how, build a pool of talents, and anchor themselves locally. While these benefits equally apply to large companies, which can afford training more apprentices - my company, for instance, trains around 300 apprentices of 15 professions every year - the dual approach of apprenticeship makes it a promising avenue for both companies and youths, since the company works closely with the apprentices and develops them. The apprentices know the job, the people, and the working environment early in their careers, so that they can decide for themselves the next steps after the apprenticeship.

They learn from successes like a better documented program, an automated workflow, and better performance thanks to better data partition. Even more, they learn from making mistakes and getting timely, constructive feedback from the trainer: Why did the program take forever? Probably because we have made it read too many files. How about restricting the reading procedure to the essential data?

## Challenges

So ganz frei "waehlen" kann man ja nicht. Es haengt schon zusammen mit der Benotung u.a. Ich wuerde auch erwaehnen, dass die grosse Mehrheit der Schueler eine Lehre beginnt (die Zahlen muesste ich nachschauen, 60-70%?). Aber es besteht grosser Druck von innen wie aussen (beginnend mit Eltern/Familie, Umfeld, Politik, etc), dass immer mehr Jugendliche das Gymnasium besuchen und dann studieren anstatt den "traditionellen" Weg ueber die Lehre einschlagen.

## Input from Manu

Danke f√ºrs Teilen. Es liest sich sehr gut. Ich glaube, du brichst hier eine Lanze f√ºr die Ausbildungsberufe. Ich erlebe gerade selbst, wie hoch qualifiziert, selbstst√§ndig und gut ausgebildet unsere Lehrlinge sind, im Vergleich zu manchen Masterstudenten, bei denen das Investment viel gr√∂sser ist, ihnen praktische Skills beizubringen, die an der Uni nicht gelehrt wurden... Meinen Lehrling kann ich z.B. getrost alleine im Labor arbeiten lassen und mich darauf verlassen, dass er das Richtige tut, bei meiner Masterstudentin stehe ich relativ h√§ufig daneben und muss ihr noch sehr viele praktische Dinge zeigen.
Azubis sind sehr gut vorbereitet f√ºr den Praxisalltag, wenn sie ausgelernt haben, Studenten lernen den praktischen Teil  meist erst im Berufsleben.
Ich denke, der ganz grosse Vorteil einer Berufsausbildung gegen√ºber dem akademischen Studium ist ein durchweg standardisiertes System, d.h. ein Laborant in Schaffhausen muss das gleiche k√∂nnen, wie ein Laborant in Basel resp. in Hamburg.  An Universit√§ten hingegen gibt es weder Qualit√§tsparameter noch Standardisierungen der Lehrinhalte, das unterscheidet sich von Uni zu Uni und von Fachbereich zu Fachbereich. Selbst die Pr√ºfungen sind √ºberall unterschiedlich aufgestellt (ausser bei Staatsexamen). Da gilt: entweder du bringst es dir selbst bei oder du hast jemanden, der sich deiner annimmt, um es dir zu zeigen, so zumindest habe ich es erlebt. Je nach Engagement der einzelnen Dozenten. 

Man k√∂nnte allerdings geneigt sein zu fragen: Wenn die Berufsausbildung so gut ist, warum studieren danach trotzdem noch so viele direkt weiter? M√∂glicherweise, weil der Ausbildungsberuf/ Abschluss gegen√ºber einer akademischen Ausbildung immer noch zu wenig Anerkennung erf√§hrt?

## Input from Iakov

1. maybe you can come up with a way to add "plot twist" to the first page? e.g., explain more why apprenticeship is consider inferior, to then break the expectations by explaining why it's actually such a good strategy. I remember you mentioned that you could still decide to go to uni, but having a "business" perspective will give you much deeper understanding of how these things that you learn are used.

I think especially in the "snobby" academic environment one needs to explain more why there are other choices which are good and maybe even better

2. i was not sure "web server" was a convincing example. it could mean very different things (depending on the complexity). I would suggest strengthening it somehow. either by giving some kind of a contrast (e.g., you got stuck yourself, or that not everyone would've been able to help even from our group).
and a bonus point üôÇ I think the decision whether it will be published or not will mostly depend on how exciting the beginning is. I'd say you need some kind of a hook, a riddle to make sure that the reader is pulled into the story.

the second part is very exciting already.


## Feedback by Huixin

I think you wrote really nice: it explains the system very well; it is fun to read the real examples and put together your personal observations; also very nicely mixed with some anecdotes. One question: do get to be an apprentice? is it a choice or a selection?
Besides, I can see that you have shown how apprentices learn during process, which contributed to their choices for future. Maybe you want to explain a bit more on how such experience helps shape the plan for their future on both personal and professional development?

Here's a brief version: students are classified into three levels: A (allgemein, i.e. general), E (enhanced), and P (pro-gymansium). Both E and A students have to do apprenticeship. P can go into gymnasium, or do an internship.
Roche is such an attractive¬†apprenticeship trainer¬†so that we get mostly P students, as well as college dropouts.
