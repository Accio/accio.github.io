Supplementary information for the blog post

The apprenticeship system sets a high standard while offering a plural definition of success. Part of my job is to support them to prepare for the final examination, known as the Individual Project Work. During the ten-day examination, they work independently in order to deliver a software project as well as a full-fledged written report. After the ten-day exam, the apprentice gives a presentation and demonstrates the product to the mentor and two external experts acting as examiners. Finally, the three experts will conduct an oral exam with the apprentice, which must cover six different topics in informatics. The examination, in my opinion, exemplifies the outstanding organisation of the apprenticeship system.

The apprenticeship system values feedback. Every semester, apprentices have a formal discussion with their supervisor and a professional trainer representing the company. All parties give each other feedback, focusing on different aspects of growth of the apprentice: professional development, team work, customer-oriented thinking, way of working, as well as the ability to reflect. While I was being trained by the company to become an apprentice supervisor, we simulated such sessions in order to improve our skills to set expectations, to appraise achievements, to identify problems or mistakes, and to explore ways to solve them. Those simulations and the following real sessions that I have had with Jannick, Giulia, and other apprentices have taught me valuable lessons on coaching people as a gardener who cultures growth.

Apprenticeships are highly valued in German-speaking countries though used to be little known outside. However, more countries, including the U.S., U.K., and China, have shown growing interest in adopting the system. As an immigrant born in China, where the apprenticeship system had a long history but was until recently sidelined, I predict the change will have a huge positive impact in many countries by creating values to society, giving new views on innovation and thereby reducing youth unemployment.

Why is the apprenticeship system so successful? First of all, it has a long history in German-speaking countries including Switzerland. The state subsidised vocational training as early as 1884. However, various forms of apprenticeship have also been exercised in many other countries including China for hundreds of years. What makes the Swiss model so special?

My personal conclusion is that it fits the reality of Switzerland, where more than 99% of the private sector is small business with less than 250 people. Apprentices learn both theory and practical skills needed by the industry, both in classrooms and by working with experienced professionals. By training the youngsters, companies maintain their know-how, build a pool of talents, and anchor themselves locally. While these benefits equally apply to large companies, which can afford training more apprentices - my company, for instance, trains around 300 apprentices of 15 professions every year - the dual approach of apprenticeship makes it a promising avenue for both companies and youths, since the company works closely with the apprentices and develops them. The apprentices know the job, the people, and the working environment early in their careers, so that they can decide for themselves the next steps after the apprenticeship.

They learn from successes like a better documented program, an automated workflow, and better performance thanks to better data partition. Even more, they learn from making mistakes and getting timely, constructive feedback from the trainer: Why did the program take forever? Probably because we have made it read too many files. How about restricting the reading procedure to the essential data?
