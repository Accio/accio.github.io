Chapter 10 of the Book *Emotional Intelligence in Everyday Life*, Second Edition, edited by Joseph Ciarrochi, Joseph P. Forgas, and John. Mayer. The authors of the chapter are Joseph Ciarrochi and John T. Blackledge.

If we look at wars, racism, bullying, murder, and suicide, we must admit that emotional *un*intelligence is everywhere.

## Definitions

The goal of the authors is to identify the conditions that promote effectiveness and reduce suffering, and to use the knowledge to influence behavior (instead of only to predict behavior). Effectiveness is the achievement of goals are determined by each individual. Suffering is difficult to define, but can be measured by scores on negative indices of well-being (for instance depression and anxiety), and/or an increase of scores on positive indices of well-being (for instance life satisfaction)

The authors distinguish between emotional intelligence and emotionally intelligent behavior. Emotional intelligence refers to someone's ability to process emotions and to deal effectively with them. It refers to people's *potential*. In contrast, emotionally intelligent behavior refers to how effectively people actually behave in the presence of emotions and emotionally charged thoughts. It refers to people's *(re)action* to emotions.

Emotionally unintelligent behavior occurs when emotions impede effective action, and emotionally intelligent behavior occurs when emotions do not impede effective action, or when emotions facilitate effective action.


Example of emotionally intelligent behavior:

1. If you are anxious about what the doctor may say about your loss of weight, does the feeling stop you from going to a health checkup? We assume that if doing so, it would be inconsistent with your goal of maintaining health.
2. If you are very angry at a friend because he badmouths you, do you hit him? We assume that your goal is to maintain friendly relations.
3. If you feel sad because your loved one is diagnosed with a terminal illness, does this stop you from caring for her? Assuming that you value such care.

These are three examples of emotionally unintelligent behaviors. In these cases, the emotions seem to be evoked or directly associated with the actions. Consider examples below:

1. If you are anxious about a lay-off, does the feeling stop you from going to a health checkup? Assuming that your goal is to maintain health.
2. If you are very angry because friend A badmouths you, do you get angry at B, who is a good friend of both you and A? Assuming that your goal is to maintain friendly relations.
3. If you feel sad because you are laid-off, does this stop you from caring for a loved one? Assuming that you value such care.

These are apparently emotionally unintelligent behaviours, too. However, given circumstances, we may feel stuck in negative emotions, ruminate about them, and make such unintelligent behaviors. An emotionally intelligent person will feel anxious *and* get a health checkup, feel angry *and* treat people with respect, and feel sad *and* support loved ones. If you perceive emotions, accept them, and nevertheless pursue your value and goals, you are emotionally intelligent.

In this model, emotionally intelligent behavior reduces unnecessary suffering, because people move towards what they value. In another word, reduced suffering is an after-effect of people engaging in emotionally intelligent behavior and moving towards their goals. If you feel sad and continue to things that you value, you are less likely to experience depression, because you consistently engage in activities that are meaningful and joyful for you, and they will minimize the likelihood of developing depression over the long term. Similarly, if you experiences anxiety about an upcoming test, and focuses on studying for it, rather than procrastinating, then you are less likely to experience excessive anxiety and regret. Ironically, if you try to avoid studying and avoid thinking about the test, you may experience more anxiety in the long run.

The key question is which processes are presumed to promote emotionally intelligent behavior, and which can be modified by an invention. The goal is to help people lead better, more vital lives.

## Causes of emotionally unintelligence: language-based processes

This part was an eye-opener for me: The psychological suffering is primarily due to the way language works. This insight derives from the Relational Frame Theory and the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT).

Relational Frame Theory (RFT) posits that the way we think about our experiences dramatically changes those experiences, by transforming direct contingency stimulus functions. In another word, the way we think about our experiences alters our impressions of what is actually going, and lead us to act as if the illusory world created through abstract thoughts is real.

RFT endorses that notion that, although we can only ever be completely certain that thoughts referring to phenomena we can directly perceive with our five senses are effectively "real", we are often erroneously convinced that thoughts referring to abstract, non-sensible phenomena are just as true and accurate. In my own words, while the thoughts about senses are true (e.g. I feel heart racing, hot, ...), judgments about these thoughts are not true (e.g. I should not feel hot now).

For instance, I can be certain that I feel anxious, because I can physically sense bodily signs of anxiety (rapid heart beat, tense shoulders, sweaty skins, etc.). But the evaluative thoughts that anxiety is *bad* and *there is something wrong with me* for feeling anxious, and the prescriptive thought that *I must avoid anxiety or bad things will happen*, do not refer to stimulus prosperties that can be directly sensed.

RFT predicts that virtually any human experience, including emotion, can be arbitrarily evaluated or judged, which lead to unnecessary behavioral limitations and predictions. There are virtually unlimited ways in which we can be weighted, measured, and found wanting by our minds. The hope lies in the fact that these measurements are not real.

An awareness of the illusory qualities of language free us from evaluating our emotions and other aspects of our experience. The emotionally intelligent person is able to recognize unpleasant emotions for what they are: constellations of physiological sensations, thoughts, and behavioral predispositions that are not intrinsically harmful. Emotions play important roles in evolution, maintaining homeostasis, and surviving. An emotionally intelligent person experiences emotions fully and willingly, and does not let emotion alone determine what he is going to do next. The emotionally unintelligent person views the negative evaluations and prescriptive thoughts surrounding emotions as fundamentally true and behaviorally binding (an unintelligent person may think if I feel angry, I must act aggressively and get revenge, though getting revenge may not be the best option to achieve his or her goal).

The Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) uses the acronym FEAR to describe how emotional unintelligence develops:

* Fusion: Cognitive fusion happens when we "take our thoughts too seriously" and assume that what we believe corresponds to immutable truths. Technically, cognitive fusion is a process that enables language's ability to transform direct stimulus functions. For instance, a women who fuses a verbal rule stating that anger must never be expressed may be ineffective at solving interpersonal conflicts, because following this rule would often prohibit an open discussion of her perspective and grievances. While fusion with evaluation and verbal rules can confer a short-term psychological or behavioral advantage, they enhance psychological suffering and contribute to more maladaptive behavior.
* Evaluation: Language allows us to create labels (e.g. anxiety and sadness) for our internal states.  Labels can be evaluated, and particularly negatively. When these negative evaluations are fused, we may try to avoid the internal states just as we avoid genuinely threatening external events. We may generate even more abstract labels such as "my life". Next one may evaluate the life as 'valueless', thereby causing psychological pathology. Also, language allows us to create ideals about ourselves (I want to look ... earn ... be ...), other people (she should ... and should not ...) and the world (the world should ...). Minds compare the ideal to present reality, and find the present unacceptable. Social comparison and negative self-evaluation are pervasive, and linked to suffering.
* Avoidance: avoiding threats in the outside world is often adaptive. Humans create an internal, private world of symbols, and earn to avoid aspects of it, for instance by suppressing unpleasant experiences, or by seeking to modify such experiences. However, the avoidance has a paradoxical rebound effect: The more one tries to avoid an experience, the more it can dominate one's life.
* Reason giving or rule creation: People learn to consider reasons as valid and sensible causes of behavior. Unfortunately, people begin to believe their own reasons and stories, even when they do not correspond well to actual, direct contingencies, and are harmful or unproductive if followed. People may tell themselves "I must have other people's approval*, and waste a lot of energy trying to get approval everyone. The reason *I must have other people's approval* is simply wrong: I do not have to other people's approval. I am valuable on my own, no matter what others say.

## Processes and measures that undermine FEAR and promote emotionally intelligent behaviors

Adapted from the table 10.1 of the book.

### 1. Effective emotional orientation

1. Letting go of unhelpful strategies of emotion control (addiction, avoidance, etc.)
2. Willingness to have emotionally charged private experiences (thoughts, images, emotions), when doing so fosters effective action.
3. Accepting the inevitability of a certain amount of unpleasant affect (feeling or emotion) and negative self-evaluation
4. Understanding that private experiences do not have to stop one from pursing a valued direction, and therefore one does not have to get rid of these experiences.

A rule of thumb regarding private experience is, "If you are not willing to have it, you have it". This is completely different from the rule of public experience. If you are not willing to have something unpleasant in the public world (e.g. an ugly painting), you can usually remove from it. However, if you are not willing to have any feelings caused by confrontations with others (e.g. anxiety), you have it.

The key is to see emotional problems as a challenge, and face problems.

### 2. Using emotion as information, not directive

1. Identifying emotions
2. Understanding the appraisals (evaluations or estimates) that activate different emotions.
3. Understanding the consequences of emotions on cognition, health, etc.
4. Understanding how emotions progresses over time.
5. Distinguishing between helpful and unhelpful emotions and emotionally charged thoughts.

Appraisal theory states that our appraisal (evaluation) of a situation (for instance the first date) causes an emotional, or affective, response that is going to be based on that appraisal (happy when positive, dejection when negative).

### 3. Dufusing from unhelpful thoughts and emotions

This process aims to undermine the power of unhelpful thoughts and emotions to act as barriers to effective action.

1. Seeing that emotionally charged thoughts about life are not equivalent to life. Emotionally charged thoughts about anything is not about that thing.
2. Looking *at* emotionally charged ways of framing (thinking about) experiences, rather than *through* them.
3. Being able to be mindful and accepting of moment to moment experience (either internal or external).

Language is so powerful that people come to see their verbal construction of life as equivalent to life itself. People fail to distinguish between the verbal constructions and the actual experience. Example: associations of the word "milk" (white, cold, lipid, ...). Repeat the words for 45 seconds reduces the associations.

Thinking is a behavior we engage in, rather than immutable reflection of reality. Thinking in words color our perceptions of our direct experiences. Words are simply maps of the terrain, not the terrain itself - and that these maps are often grossly inadequate.

Defusion involves a fundamental in context. It involves looking at the feelings, thoughts, sensations, and memories that show up from moment to moment, watching them as they go away. Except from physical sensations, experience in form of thoughts are stream of words, which change physical sensations and urges, rather than what our minds say our direct experiences are.

Mindfulness includes *what* skills (e.g. observing things as they come and go, describing them, and participating fully in life), and *how* skills (i.e. taking a non-judgemental stance, mindfully focus on what you are doing, doing what works and what makes joy). Essentially mindfulness help people to see their moment-to-moment experience as it is, not as it seems to be when seen through language or intense emotion.

Mindlessly seeing life through unhelpful thoughts leads to suffering. Ellis proposed four major classes of unhelpful thoughts:

* Demandingness ("This *must* be in a certain way.")
* Low distress tolerance ("I cannot stand it.")
* Awfulizing ("My life is awful.")
* Global evaluation ("I am completely good or bad; work is completely bad")

The key to mindfulness is not to get rid of the thoughts. It is to accept whatever thoughts show up during the course of pursing goals (i.e. effective orientation), and to learn to look at thoughts, rather than through the thoughts. I am willing to have unpleasant thoughts, and not believe them.

It reminds of the three poisons of Buddhism:

* Craving, greed
* Aversion, hate
* Delusion, confusion

Rumination, i.e. keep thinking about the past or jumping from one negative thought to another, reflects high fusion. Rumination can happen when one tries to control things that are uncontrollable (uncertainty, other people's thoughts and actions, etc.) Rumination is also an ineffective emotional orientation or control strategy, because it involves attempts to use reasoning to escape from unpleasant private experiences, chewing unpleasant experiences again and again in memory. Rumination is a mindless absorption in the content of the thought (fusion), rather than look at thoughts. The focus of rumination is either in the past or in the future, while the present goes unnoticed.

### 4. Defusing from unhelpful self-concepts

This process aims to undermine the power of unhelpful self-concepts to act as barriers to effective action.

1. Recognizing that self-evaluations are not descriptions of our essence.
2. Escaping the perceived need to defend self-esteem.
3. Looking at, rather than through, self-evaluations.
4. Recognizing that emotionally charged evaluations of the self do not have to stop us from pursuing our goals.
5. Making contact with the "observer self": Finding safe place from which to accept accept all negative emotions, self-doubts, and other unpleasant inner experiences.

Evaluations (good, bad, incomplete, careless,...) are not innate and formal property. They are judgements, abstractions relying on arbitrary (but conventionalized) criteria, not uniformly verifiable as one's physical properties and attributes.

Formal and intrinsic properties: physical sensible
Abstract stimulus properties: judgements rooting in thoughts, not formally binding. The universe does not know or care if one is bad or good, because the concepts of badness and goodness are simply verbal constructions. They are not immutable truths, but verbal illusions that need not have a binding domination over one's life.


Verbal concept of 'me' does not equal to the actual 'me'. People are drawn to protect the concept of self as if it is part of the self. They seek to feed it, or defend it against attack. Low self-esteem involves negative evaluation of the entire self, and fusion with these evaluations. Undermining fusion is different from building self-esteem. The goal of undermining fusion is not to get rid of the negative thoughts and replace them with positive ones. Rather, it is to accept the negative self-evaluations as words that may inevitably show up, and to look at them, rather than through them.

### 5. Effective action orientation

1. Clear awareness of values and their relative importance.
2. Ability to take action that is consistent with goals and values, even in the context of
	1. Impulses, fears, lack of confidence
	2. Uncertainty, doubt
	3. Feelings of exhaustion or fatigue
	4. Physical pain
	5. Intense emotion
3. Ability to sustain committed action in the face of inconsistent feedback, frustration, and failure.
4. Ability to recognize mistakes that lead one away from the goals and values, accept them, learn lessons, and do it differently next time.
