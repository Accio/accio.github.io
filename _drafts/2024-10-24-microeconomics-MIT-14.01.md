## Lecture 1

Microeconomics: the study of how individuals and firms make decisions in a world of scarcity.

Microeconomics is a series of constrained optimization, where economic agents try to make themselves as well off as possible, given their constraints. Given the constraints, we need to make trade-offs.

Opportunity cost: every action or every inaction has a cost that you could have used for another purpose, there's a next alternative best. There is always an opportunity cost. Founder: Paul Samuelson, MIT, 1940-50, who used engineering concepts to build the foundation of modern economics.

First model: the demand and supply model. Model: relations between two or more variables. Despite simplicity, the model can explain a broad set of phenomena.

Three levels of understanding

* Intuitive test: the Mom test, where you understand and explain it
* Graphical test: have a lot of power
* Mathematical test: probably the least important, but easy to test on

Adam Smith brought up in 1776 the Wealth of Nations the concept of supply and demand: the Water Diamond paradox. His answer is the supply and demand scissors.

The demand curve: relation between the price of a good, and how much people want it. It has a negative slope (downward sloping): the higher the price is (y-axis), the smaller the demand is (x-axis), vice versa.
The supply curve: relation between the price of a good, and how much good can be produced. It has a positive slope: the higher the price is (y-axis), the higher the supply will be.

Where the demand and supply curve meets is the market equilibrium. The point where both parties are happy to make a transaction.

Positive versus normative analysis:

* Positive analysis: the study of the way things are.
* Normative analysis: the study of the way things should be.

Positive question: why the high price of bid kidney?
Normative question: should you be allowed to sell kidney on eBay?

What are the problems?

1. Market failures
	1. Fraud
	2. Imperfect information (odds of living with one functional kidney for the rest of your life)
2. Equity, or fairness: we may end up in a world where only rich people have two kidneys
3. Behavioral economics: people make mistakes due to cognitive bias

You cannot get into normative analysis (should) before doing positive analysis (is) well.

The standard view is 'the market knows the best'. US has a capitalist market and high inequity. In contrast is the command economy: the government allocates the roads: corruption for party members, and waiting in line for everybody.

* Checks and balances
* It's hard to control human nature, invisible hand: the capitalist economy manages to distribute things roughly in proportion to what people want.

The invisible hand theory: consumers and firms serving their own best interest will do what ends up doing the best for society. 'Maximum surplus'.

Structure:

* Demand: utility maximization, budget constrains
* Supply: how much firms decide to produce
* Market equilibrium
* How market equilibrium breaks in reality: market failures, equity, behavioural economics, ...

Recitations: problem sets

## Lecture 2: Preferences and Utility Functions

Demand curve: how consumers make decisions

Model: utility maximization

* Preferences (maximal demand)
* Budget constraint (afford)

We start with three preference *assumptions* (check them!):

1. Completeness: you know how you feel, you have a choice.
2. Transitivity: if you prefer A to B, and B to C, then you prefer A to C.
3. Non-satiation: more is better less, you always want more (the first human aspect, not only mathematics anymore).

Graphical representation: indifference maps

Example of two choices, pizza (P) and cookie (C)

* Choice A: 2P, 1C
* Choice B: 1P, 2C
* Choice C: 2P, 2C

Indifference with regard to A and B is an assumption, while C is preferred (more is better).

The indifference curve looks like contour plot, represents all combinations along which you are indifferent.

Four properties of the indifference curves

1. Consumers prefer higher indifference curves (more is better), higher means in x-y plot the curve sits above another curve.
2. Indifference curve is downward sloping. It comes from non-satiation.
3. Indifference curve never cross. Because otherwise it would violates transitivity.
4. There is only one indifference curve (IC) through every consumption bundle.

Indifference curve helps to make decisions, if I know what do I care when making the decision? For instance, location and quality of economics department.

Graphically, mathematical, and intuitive understanding.

Utility function: stable, well-behaving mathematical representation of preferences. For instance, $f=\sqrt{P\timesC}$.

Utility is not a cardinal concept, it's only an ordinal concept. Utility allows you to rank choices. It allows you to combine different factors and rank choices.

Marginal utility: derivative of the utility function, it's always about the next cookie, always looking forward.

Diminishing marginal utility: $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2x}}$. barf=vomiting. You can still have the 11th cookie: you can give it away, you can save it for later, etc.

The slope of the indifference curve is called the marginal rate of substitution (MRS). The rate at which you are willing to substitute one with the other. $MRS=\frac{\delta P}{\delta C}$, P and C are pizza and cookies. MRS has to diminish, marginal rate of substitution is always falling. As you go along the indifference curve, the slope is always diminishing. $MRS=\frac{\delta P}{\delta C}=-\frac{MU_c}{á¸¾U_p}$. Negative of the marginal utility of good on the x-axis, over the marginal utility of good on the y-axis.

Marginal utilities are negative functions of quantity: the more you have of you have a thing, the less you want to next unit.

Indifference curves are *convex* or linear to the original, but not concave. A concave indifference curve violates the principle of diminishing marginal utility and of diminishing marginal rate of substitution.

a relishing question: to relish means to like or to enjoy

addictive: habituated to certain levels. Oxycontin --> Heroin --> Fentanyl, synthetic opinoiod

The prices of difference sizes of goods, e.g. Starbucks. Diminishing marginal utility.

If you have already got something, getting another unit of that thing will make you less happier (though still happier). This is known as the diminishing marginal utility. It is reflected on the supply-demand graphics: doubling the unit won't push the price as twice, rather it will only induce smaller increments.

## Lecture 3: Budget constraints and constrained choice

* Budget constraints
* Constrained choice
* Food stamps

Assumption: budget equals income.

The median American household has 400 dollars (yes! He said 400 dollars) in the bank. [Latest data](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/average-american-savings/) suggests that it's about 5000 dollars. It varies by age. Even for baby boomers (>=60), the median savings and incomes is about 50000.

$$Y = P_P * P + P_C * C$$

Assuming that a pizza costs 12 dollars, and a cookie 6 dollars. The budget is 72 dollars.

Budget constraint is a line with downward sloping with a slope of $-p_c/-p_p$. The slope is marginal rate of substitution (MRS).

Opportunity cost: the value of the next best alternative. The opportunity cost of a pizza is two cookies.

Weight Watchers: points attached to food. Budget constraints. People like choices.

How about shocking the budget constraint?

Increasing the price of y-axis flattens the line - pivot inwards. The pivot means that the slope changes.

Opportunity set: the set of choices available to you, given your income and market prices.

The slope is controlled by the market. Income determines the levels (integration).

Constrained choice: utilty and constrained budget. Given your budget, what's the highest level of indifference curve you can achieve?

The optimum, graphically, is the tangency between the indifference curve and the budget contraint. it is the optimal constrianed bundle.

the tangency, (6,3), is the point of maximum utils, $\sqrt(6*3)$.

The math is always about marginal rate of substitute.

MRS=-MUc/MUp
MRT=-Pc/Pp

The ratio of the benefits (MRS, what you want) equals to the ratio of the costs (MRT, what the market wants).

MUc/Pc=MUp/Pp. Happiness per dollar spent on cookie, equals to the happiness per dollar spent on pizza. 'Bang for your buck'. The same slope of the indifference curve and that of the budget constraint.

MRS=-MUc/MUp=-2.5, you are willing to give up 2.5 pizzas for one cookie, where MRT (the market asks you) is 0.5.

The whole course is about marginal benefit equals marginal cost. If we take the next stpe, what's the marginal benefit, and what's the marginal cost?

Applications: food stamps. Poverty line in U.S. is 14000$, for a family of four it's 24000.

SNAP: debit card for food and food only if you are poor enough.

Imagine the two goods are food and shelter. The debit card instead of cash makes the budget constraint line is kinked line. Forcing people who prefer to spend on sheltering to spend more on food. Replace shelter with cocaine. We force people to buy food instead of buying sheltering (cocaine). Paternalistic.

Do food stamps really increase food consumption? Start with theorectical models, and do experiments. Randominized trial. WHen replacing stamp with cash, people spend 15\% less on food. The price of our paternalism is 15\%.
