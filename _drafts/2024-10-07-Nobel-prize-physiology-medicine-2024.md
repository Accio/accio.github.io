My sincere congratulations go to Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun, who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2024 for the discovery of microRNA and its role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. The news brought me back to my PhD time, when I became familiar with and fascinated by microRNAs.

A major part of my PhD work was about inferring functions of microRNA, studying how microRNA regulates gene expression in diseases such as breast cancer, and using microRNA as diagnostic tools.
