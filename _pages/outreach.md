I am committed to knowledge sharing and continuous learning.

## Consulting and reviewing

I have consulted universities and research institutes for scientific questions
and project proposals. Besides reviewing scientific publications, I have
participated in reviewing scientific proposals in the field of bioinformatics,
computational biology, and translational biomedical sciences for both
international and national funding agencies. References are available upon
request.

## Teaching

Teaching is my personal engagement. I thank the great support and input from
colleagues at Roche and other companies, colleagues at the Department of
Mathematics and Computer Science and the Department of Pharmacy, University of
Basel, and support by ETH D-BSSE and Computational Biology and Bioinformatics
(CBB) master program, as well as students who take the courses.

### AMIDD

In autumn semesters, I teach a undergraduate-level course series, *Applied
Mathematics and Informatics in Drug Discovery* (AMIDD), at the Department of Mathematics
and Computer Science, University of Basel.

Check out the material of *Applied Mathematics and Informatics In Drug
Discovery* on its website [AMIDD.ch](http://amidd.ch).

### MCBDD

In spring semesters, I teach an advanced course series, *Mathematical and
Computational Biology in Drug Discovery* (MCBDD) as a follow-up course of AMIDD.
Its material can be found on the course's website [MCBDD.ch](http://mcbdd.ch).

### From Novel Targets To Novel Therapeutics

In spring semesters, I teach one lecture of the course series *From Novel
Targets to Novel Therapeutics* on topics of computational biology and multiscale
modelling at the Department of Pharmacy, University of Basel.

## Supervising and training

I work with junior researchers, including bachelor, master and PhD students as
well as postdoc researchers regularly. My responsibility includes

* supervision of internships,
* mentoring projects and thesis,
* consulting personal and professional development,
* organizing teamwork in computational biology and its application in drug discovery.

Furthermore, I give talks to informatics apprentices and high-school students to
introduce them computational biology and applied mathematics and informatics in
drug discovery. I also give Carpentry courses as a certificated Instructor and
help organising internships.

References of supervised students and postdoc researchers are available upon
request.

If you consider doing a postdoc in Pharma, these [Ten Simple
Rules](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008989)
might be useful.
