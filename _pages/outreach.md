Besides working as a scientist, I enjoy serving people and communities by sharing knowledge, and learning from them in turn.

## Consultant and board member

I serve from time to time as an independent consultant for international and national agencies, universities, research institutes, and companies. My responsibilities in these roles include reviewing project proposals, allocating resources, and recruiting senior staff. My focus area include computational biology, translational research, and drug discovery and development.

[Contact me](mailto:mail@jdzhang.me?subject=Inviatation to serve as an consultant or board member) if you are interested in engaging me as an independent consultant, expert, or board member. References are available upon request.

## Mentoring and coaching
<a href="#top" style="font-size: 11px;">Back to top</a>

I work closely and regularly with junior researchers, including apprentices of *Berufsausbildung*, bachelor, master and PhD students, as well as postdoc
researchers.

My responsibility includes

* supervision of *Berufsausbildung* (professional development) apprentices,
* supervision of internships of bachelor, master, and PhD students,
* mentoring projects and theses,
* consulting personal and professional development,
* organizing teamwork in computational biology and its application in drug discovery.

## Teaching
<a href="#top" style="font-size: 11px;">Back to top</a>

### Applied Mathematics and Informatics in Drug Discovery (AMIDD)

In autumn semesters, I teach a undergraduate-level course series, *Applied Mathematics and Informatics in Drug Discovery* (AMIDD), at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Basel. Check out the material of *Applied Mathematics and Informatics In Drug Discovery* on its website [AMIDD.ch](http://amidd.ch).

### Mathematical and Computational Biology in Drug Discovery (MCBDD)

In spring semesters, I teach an advanced course series, *Mathematical and Computational Biology in Drug Discovery* (MCBDD) as a follow-up course of AMIDD. Its material can be found on the course's website [MCBDD.ch](http://mcbdd.ch).

### Other courses

In spring semesters, I teach one lecture of the course series *From Novel Targets to Novel Therapeutics* on topics of computational biology and multiscale modelling at the Department of Pharmacy, University of Basel.


I have organized Python courses `Python@Library` for secondary-school students in Basel in GGG Library, together with computer science apprentices of Roche. The first edition took place in 2024.


## Public talks
<a href="#top" style="font-size: 11px;">Back to top</a>

I regularly talks to other experts in drug discovery, general public and students. Most of these talks are about computational biology, applied mathematics and informatics, and drug discovery. Below is a selection. If you are in interested in inviting me for a talk, please [contact me](mailto:mail@jdzhang.me?subject=Invitation to give a talk). References are available upon request.
