Hi, I am David, a computational biologist in drug discovery. [Find my CV here](https://github.com/Accio/CV/blob/master/JitaoDavidZhang_CV.pdf).

I work as a researcher at F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland. My work
helps to identify new, efficacious, and safe drug candidates.

My research roots in interdisciplinary collaborations with academic and industrial partners. Whenever feasible, we share the outcome in [open-access publicatons]({{site.url}}/publications) and with [open-source software]({{site.url}}/software).

Besides performing research, I teach [courses]({{site.url}}/outreach#teaching), mentor [apprentices, students and postdocs]({{site.url}}/outreach#supervising-and-training), give [public talks]({{site.url}}/outreach#public-talks), and fulfilling scientific and community duties including [consulting and reviewing]({{site.url}}/outreach#consulting-and-reviewing).

I enjoy spending time with my family, reading, writing, playing piano, and jogging.
