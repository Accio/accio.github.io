I am Jitao David Zhang, a computational biologist working at F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland. [Find my CV here](https://github.com/Accio/CV/blob/master/JitaoDavidZhang_CV.pdf).

My research helps to identify novel drug candidates and to characterize their
efficacy and safety profiles.

To achieve this, I integrate biological knowledge with mathematical and statistical
thinking, and create both software tools and computation-enhanced wet-lab workflows.

I collaborate both internally at Roche and externally with academic and
industrial partners. We share the results in [open-access
papers]({{site.url}}/publications) and by [open-source
software]({{site.url}}/software).

I also [teach courses, supervise students and postdocs, and give public
talks]({{site.url}}/outreach).

Besides spending time with my family, I read, write, play piano, and jog.
