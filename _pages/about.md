Hi, I am David, a computational biologist in drug discovery. [Find my CV here](https://github.com/Accio/CV/blob/master/JitaoDavidZhang_CV.pdf).

I work as a scientist at the research department of F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland. My work helps to identify new, efficacious, and safe drug candidates. My research roots in interdisciplinary collaborations with academic and industrial partners. Whenever feasible, we share the outcome in [open-access publications and open-source software]({{site.url}}/research).

Besides performing research, I enjoying working with and learning from people. I serve as [an independent consultant and board member]({{site.url}}/outreach#consultant-and-board-member) for universities, research institutes, companies, and funding agencies. I act as a mentor and coach for [apprentices, students and postdocs]({{site.url}}/outreach#mentoring-and-coaching). I teach [regular courses]({{site.url}}/outreach#teaching) at the University of Basel, give [public talks]({{site.url}}/outreach#public-talks), and [work with youths]({{site.url}}/outreach#working-with-youths) to share my enthusiasm in mathematics, informatics, natural sciences and technology.

I enjoy spending time with my family, reading, writing, playing piano, jogging, and going on bike tours.
