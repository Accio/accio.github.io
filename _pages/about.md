Hi, I am David, a computational biologist in drug discovery. [Find my CV here](https://github.com/Accio/CV/blob/master/JitaoDavidZhang_CV.pdf).

I work as a researcher at F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland. My work helps to identify new, efficacious, and safe drug candidates. My research roots in interdisciplinary collaborations with academic and industrial partners. Whenever feasible, we share the outcome in [open-access publications and open-source software]({{site.url}}/research).

Besides performing research, I enjoying working with and learning from people. I supervise and mentor [apprentices, students and postdocs]({{site.url}}/leading#supervision-and-mentoring). I teach [courses]({{site.url}}/leading#teaching) and give [public talks]({{site.url}}/leading#public-talks). Also I serve as [independent expert and board members]({{site.url}}/leading#serving-as-independent-expert-and-board-member).

I enjoy spending time with my family, reading, writing, playing piano, and jogging.
