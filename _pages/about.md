Hi, I am David, a computational biologist in drug discovery. [Find my CV here](https://github.com/Accio/CV/blob/master/JitaoDavidZhang_CV.pdf).

I work as a researcher at F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland. My work
helps to identify new, efficacious, and safe drug candidates.

My research roots in interdisciplinary collaborations with academic
and industrial partners. Whenever feasible, we share the outcome in [open-access
papers]({{site.url}}/publications) and with [open-source
software]({{site.url}}/software).

I also [teach courses, supervise students and postdocs, and give public
talks]({{site.url}}/outreach).

I enjoy spending time with my family, reading, writing, playing piano, and jogging.
