## Teaching

Teaching is my personal engagement. I thank the great support and input from
colleagues at Roche, colleagues at the Department of Mathematics and Computer
Science and the Department of Pharmacy, University of Basel, and students who
take the courses.

### Applied Mathematics and Informatics in Drug Discovery

In autumn semesters, I teach a undergraduate-level course series, *Applied
Mathematics and Informatics in Drug Discovery*, at the Department of Mathematics
and Computer Science, University of Basel.

Check out the material of *Applied Mathematics and Informatics In Drug
Discovery* on its website [AMIDD.ch](http://amidd.ch).

### Mathematical and Computational Biology in Drug Discovery

In spring semesters, I teach an advanced course series, *Mathematical and
Computational Biology in Drug Discovery* as a follow-up course of *Applied
Mathematics and Informatics in Drug Discovery*. Its material can be found on the
course's website [MCBDD.ch](http://mcbdd.ch).

### From Novel Targets To Novel Therapeutics

In spring semesters, I teach one lecture of the course series *From Novel
Targets to Novel Therapeutics* on topics of computational biology and multiscale
modelling at the Department of Pharmacy, University of Basel.

## Supervising students and junior researchers

I work regularly with junior researchers, including bachelor, master and PhD
students as well as postdoc researchers. My responsibility includes

* supervision of internships,
* mentoring projects and thesis,
* consulting personal and professional development,
* organizing teamwork in computational biology and its application in drug discovery.

Furthermore, I give talks to informatics apprentices and high-school students to
introduce them computational biology and applied mathematics and informatics in
drug discovery. I also help organising internships.

References of supervised students and postdoc researchers are available upon
request.
