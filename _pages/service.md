I am fascinated by people.

I enjoy serving people and communities by sharing knowledge and learning from them in turn.

## Supervision and mentoring

I work closely and regularly with junior researchers, including apprentices of
*Berufsausbildung*, bachelor, master and PhD students, as well as postdoc
researchers. My responsibility includes

* supervision of *Berufsausbildung* (professional development) apprentices,
* supervision of internships,
* mentoring projects and theses,
* consulting personal and professional development,
* organizing teamwork in computational biology and its application in drug discovery.

If you consider doing a postdoc in Pharma, these [Ten Simple Rules](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008989) might be useful.

## Giving public talks

## Serving as independent expert and board member
<a href="#top" style="font-size: 11px;">Back to top</a>

I have served as an independent expert for international and national agencies, reviewing proposals in the fields of bioinformatics, computational biology, biomedicine, and translational research.

I have served in boards organized by universities, research institutes, and companies aiming at reviewing project proposals, applying for or allocating research funding, and recruiting new professors.

If you are interested in engaging me as an independent expert, reviewer, or board member, please [contact me](mailto:mail@jdzhang.me?subject=Inviatation to serve as an expert or board member). References are available upon request.

## Teaching
<a href="#top" style="font-size: 11px;">Back to top</a>

* In autumn semesters, I teach a undergraduate-level course series, *Applied Mathematics and Informatics in Drug Discovery* (AMIDD), at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Basel. Check out the material of *Applied Mathematics and Informatics In Drug Discovery* on its website [AMIDD.ch](http://amidd.ch).
* In spring semesters, I teach an advanced course series, *Mathematical and Computational Biology in Drug Discovery* (MCBDD) as a follow-up course of AMIDD. Its material can be found on the course's website [MCBDD.ch](http://mcbdd.ch).
* In spring semesters, I teach one lecture of the course series *From Novel Targets to Novel Therapeutics* on topics of computational biology and multiscale modelling at the Department of Pharmacy, University of Basel.

I also give courses on bioinformatics, computational biology, drug discovery, data analysis and programming (as a certified Carpentry trainer) from time to time. If you are interested in inviting me to teach, please [contact me](mailto:mail@jdzhang.me?subject=Invitation to teach).
